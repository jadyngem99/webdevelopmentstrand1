    <h3>The Internet and History</h3>
    <p>The internet is a global connection of computers and networks that are connected for the purpose of sharing information.
        There are different types of hardware and software that are used as part of the infrastructure related to accessing
        the internet. The internet is also a type of network called a Wide Area Network or WAN.</p>
    <h4>Basic Network Information</h4>
    <p>A network is when there are two or more computer devices connected for the purpose of sharing resources and information.
        Two common networks are a Local Area Network and a Wide Area Network. Networks can be as small as connecting just
        two devices or as large as connecting billions of devices. LANs are typically a type of network that can be found
        in a building, while a WAN can be several buildings or more.</p>


    <h3>Who has control of the internet?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>NO ONE controls the internet</li>
        <li>Became public in early 90's</li>

    <h3>Other Facts:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Has been around for almost 50 years</li>
        <li>Used to be called the ARPANET</li>
        <li>ARPANET was initially 3 universities connected and U of U was one of them</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Conception of the Internet to the WWW</h3>
    <p>The precursor to the Internet, known as the ARPANET, began in 1969 as part of the U.S. Defense Department. In fact, ARPANET
        stands for Advanced Research Project Agency Network. The researchers that were involved in the project were also
        responsible for many of the protocols that we use when communicating the many different ways using the internet.
