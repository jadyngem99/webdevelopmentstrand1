    <h2>Necessary Hardware and Software</h2>
    <p>In addition to paying for service through an Internet Service Provider (ISP), there is also different types of hardware
        and software that are needed to connect to the internet. Today computers can connect to the internet using cables,
        WiFi, and our cellphones.</p>
